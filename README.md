## About Me

My name is Jalen Mojica. I am currently a student at Northwest Vista College nearing graduation. I am studying to get an Associates Degree in Psychology and Game Development-Production. I know some Maya and Unity, but am still looking to improve. I also have a part-time job at a movie theater.
