Research and review the various ways you could use Heroku to implement a CI solution. Describe where the various technologies Heroku has to offer fit into each of the testing environments. Document a possible approach on how to use it for your next "online game project". Submit this as a .md page on your github.io site.

## Research and Review

You can find a CI (Continous Integration) solution by following the Heroku Flow. The Heroku Flow starts with Heroku Pipelines. Heroku Pipelines organizes a group of Heroku apps sharing the same codebase and places them into their proper testing environments to ensure continuous delivery. Heroku CI works alongside Heruko Pipelines to provide continuous integration and delivery. Heroku CI runs your test scripts, using disposable apps that flow well with your staging and production testing environments.
